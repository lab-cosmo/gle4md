     i-PI is a Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) wrapper code written
     in Python, designed to be used together with <i>ab initio</i> evaluation
     of the interactions between the atoms. The main goal is to decouple
     the problem of evolving the ionic positions to sample the appropriate
     thermodynamic ensemble and the problem of computing the inter-atomic forces.

    The implementation is based on a client-server paradigm, where i-PI
    acts as the server and deals with the propagation of the nuclear dynamics,
    whereas the calculation of the potential energy, forces and the potential
    energy part of the pressure virial is delegated to one or more instances
    of an external code, acting as clients. Since the main focus is on
    performing <i>ab initio</i> PIMD - where the cost of the force evaluation
    is overwhelming relative to the ionic dynamics - clarity has been
    privileged over speed. Still, the implementation of i-PI is efficient
    enough that it can be used with empirical forcefields to perform simple
    benchmarks and preparatory simulations.
